### Assessment Expectations

Using the below image as a guide, provide a template-powered reports page.
Your goal is to build a responsive and widely browser-compatible web-page
that accurately matches the design, layout, and content of the provided image.

Items should appear `30px` apart and flow within a 3 column grid. This grid
should also switch to a two column grid when the viewport's `width` is `768px`
or below. Consider how the page will scale as more reports are added over time.

By default, the assessment will appear broken.
It is up to you to troubleshoot any missing pieces and build atop the files
to achieve the expected result.

### Assessment Criteria

- Accuracy of design and content
- Level of efficiency and scalability for the execution of proposed layout
- Ability to fix bugs and identify syntax errors
- The page should be compatible with these browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and IE 11

### Getting Started

If you have Node.js installed on your machine, running the
project through `http-server` is an ideal strategy. Open up the project
in any CLI and run the following commands:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Otherwise, simply open the `index.html` file located within the `src` folder
in your favourite web browser.
